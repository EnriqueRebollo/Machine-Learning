# Machine-Learning-and-Computer-Vision
This repository contains the projects generated on Machine Learning topics during the Robotics Master pursued at the Università degli Studi di Genova.

The "Labs 1 to 4 REPORTS - Enrique Rebollo" file contains the reports for each Lab. They are 4 Lab assignments developed with Matlab:

  Lab 1 - NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER:
  Implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier that will determine if the user should or should not play tennis, according to 4 weather criteria: Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, and Wind.
  The database consists of 14 entries: from which 10 are randomly selected for the Training set. The remaining 4 are later used as the Test set.
  
  Lab 2 - LINEAR REGRESSION:
  Fitting and testing of different linear regression models (single and multi-dimensional models), and with and without offset models, comparing the obtained results. 
  
  Lab 3 - KNN CLASSIFIER: 
  Implementation of a k-Nearest Neighbour classifier to classify images from different numbers from 0 to 9. We focuse on which are the most challenging numbers for the algorithms and how does the size of k affect the accuracy.
  
  Lab 4 - NEURAL NETWORKS:
  In the first part, the Matlab’s Neural Network Pattern Recognition feature is applied to different datasets and with a different number of neurons in the hidden layer, comparing the results obtained.
  In the second part, an autoencoder network is used for the clustering of the MNIST images of digits already used for Lab 3.
